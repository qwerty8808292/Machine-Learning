# Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code for a machine learning project that explores various techniques in image processing and classification. The project is organized into four Jupyter Notebook files, each focusing on a specific aspect of machine learning.

### Project Structure

1. **Principal_Component_Analysis.ipynb**
   - Utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction.
     
2. **Singular_Value_Decomposition.ipynb**
   - Applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image compression and encryption.
   - Compares different reconstruction arrangements and selects optimal recombination methods.

3. **Classification.ipynb**
   - Explores the fundamentals of machine learning classification.
   - Implements and compares Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network classifiers on three different datasets.

4. **Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb**
   - Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial recognition using the Yale Face dataset.

## Datasets

- **Wine Dataset:**
  - Contains 178 samples of wine data from three regions with 13 different wine components.

- **AT&T Faces Dataset:**
  - Consists of 400 face images of 10 individuals, each with a size of 64x64 pixels.

- **Yale Faces Dataset:**
  - Includes 2410 face images of 38 individuals, each with a size of 192x168 pixels.
 
- **MNIST Dataset:**
  - The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).
 
- **Lenna Image:**
  - The Lenna image is a standard test image widely used in the field of image processing. It is a photograph of the Swedish model Lena SÃ¶derberg.
    
## Results

Detailed results, insights, and comparisons are provided within each notebook. Refer to the specific notebooks for a comprehensive analysis of each technique.
